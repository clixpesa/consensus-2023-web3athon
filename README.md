#### Project Description

Clixpesa is an effort to build a borderless, customer-centric, all in one platform to serve as a trusted companion to manage money while giving back control to our users. We have started with bringing the utility of ROSCAs commonly known as [Chamas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)>) in Kenya to Web3. Here users in our community and easily manage their chamas on our platform while growing their credit scores.

We have found out that the “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends. Many in the informal sector underutilize financial products due to high learning curves, costs and the commitment involved. While making payments in Kenya is easy, participating in mediums that expose users to **cheap lines of credit and saving pools** still has high friction.

#### Summary

During the course of this Hackathon, we intend to polish on our ROSCA feature and work on a **P2P lending/microloans** feature.
While members of a chama can be able to borrow from each other within their savings group. We would like to extend lending/small loans to members outside of saving groups. Such that, a user can have access to cheap loans from already established Chamas. We believe this will be very useful to support low-income earners and struggling small businesses. Chamas that invest in the microloans pool are entitled a share of interest from the loans.

##### Positive outcomes

- Interest for participating chamas.
- Credit score and credit worthiness for users.
- Real-time access to credit.
- Credit at customized terms.
