### Making money and crypto simple for everyone

### A Wallet on the XDC Network 

#### Project Description

Clixpesa is an effort to build a borderless, customer-centric, all in one platform to serve as a trusted companion to manage money while giving back control to our users. 
We have started with bringing the utility of ROSCAs commonly known as [Chamas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)>) in Kenya to Web3. Here users in our community and easily manage their chamas on our platform while growing their credit scores.

We have found out that the “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends. 
Many in the informal sector underutilize financial products due to high learning curves, costs and the commitment involved. 
While making payments in Kenya is easy, participating in mediums that expose users to cheap lines of credit and saving pools still has high friction.
